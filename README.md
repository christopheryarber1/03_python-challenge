# python-challenge
Added Folder structure as instructed, created two new python files for the anaysis. Committed/Pushed files up to GitHub to get started. 

Added main.py files, and dropped the output files in the correct location. Got my destination paths incorrect, so had to do some adjustment to get the files generating to the correct location. Python script generates output to terminal, as well as to text file.
